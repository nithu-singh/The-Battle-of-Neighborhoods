# The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
Applied Data Science Specialization -  Final Capstone Project neighborhood 


## Introduction
### Problem Background

The famous Barbeque Nation owned by Sayaji Hotels Ltd is one of the high-end buffet restaurants which takes you into the world of good food with happy vibes. It haits first outlet in Mumbai and there are nearly 40 restaurants across India since. The dining concept of the live grill lets the foodies enjoy the fun of the heavenly gourmet. The highlight of this place is its decor and unlimited starters.

You can order a wide variety of mouth-watering starters from paneer, mushroom, pineapple- chicken, fish, prawns, mutton. Also, live music would make the whole dining atmosphere perfect. A special mention to Cajun spiced potatoes, the shish kebabs, the dum Biryani and the delicious desserts that are popular choices by people.

This is just an example, there are many such food chains and restaurants across India that could go international and would be open to the idea of setting up business in Ireland.

### Problem Description

As mentioned above, these restaurant chains are as of now only serving across India, but if they were to go international, specifically open their first international chain of restaurants in Ireland. There are various factors that they’ll have to look into.
Example of few such factors are,

* What are existing food chains in Ireland? 
* How popular is Asian food in Ireland?
* Which county is more preferable to open their first restaurant ?
* Are there "similar" restaurants? If so, what specialty do that have?

This will be more of a comparative analysis of existing food chains/restaurants across few counties in Ireland.

### Tageted Audience

This is targeted towards restaurant and food cahin owners looking to open their buiseness in Irealnd and want to understand the current situation about people preferences, food popularity and exisitng businesses across required neighbourhood.  

## Data

Given the problem at hand, we’ll need a variety of data to perform our analysis. 
For starter, 
1.	To lock down on the counties for analysis, I’ll need population and ethnic dataset of different counties in Ireland.
2.	Next within those counties, I’ll again need geographical location data and population dataset of each neighborhood to determine best place to open this restaurant.
3.	Finally using foursquare data I can perform elaborate analysis on the venues across selected neighborhoods.
To elaborate,
To determine the counties and neighborhoods  for analysis, the population dataset available on Central Statistics Office website give us a breakdown of population across Ireland  based on multiple themes. 

To analyze a suitable location for restaurant, neighborhood’s Latitude and Longitude is to be known so that we can point at its coordinates and create a map displaying all the current restaurants with its labels respectively.

To gain maximum profitability it is useful to analyze the neighborhood where you want to be opening a restaurant, for this foursquare data can be very handy.
